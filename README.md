## Introduction

HoloType is an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) educational platform, using HoloLens 2 head-mounted augmented reality, designed to cater to the unique learning needs of non-speaking autistic individuals. This project represents a fusion of cutting-edge technology and a deeply human-centered approach to education. Developed using Unity, C#, and the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK), HoloType is a testament to the power of technology in making education accessible and engaging for all.

## Key Features 
Teach-Ask Approach: HoloType employs a distinctive "Teach-Ask" methodology, where educators provide brief lesson sections followed by interactive questions. This approach ensures a comprehensive learning experience.

Close Captioning Narration: All narrations come with close captioning, making the educational content accessible to individuals with diverse learning needs.

Dynamic Lessons: Educators can seamlessly customize lessons through a web portal, allowing for adaptability and personalization in the learning process.
## User-Centric Features

Multiple Choice Quizzes: Users encounter progressively challenging multiple-choice quizzes as they progress through the lessons. Users have the advantage of not one but two chances to respond to each question, creating a constructive and nurturing learning environment. After an incorrect response, the options will be rearranged, and the previously incorrect choice substituted with an alternative, to prevent any repetitive behaviors.

Visual and Audio Cues: The platform incorporates a virtual hand coach, feedback on responses, and relevant pictures that appear during keyword narrations to enhance user engagement.

Tag-Along Feature: Holograms remain visible within the user's field of view, ensuring an uninterrupted and immersive learning experience even when users move.

Multiplayer Option: HoloType facilitates shared virtual environments, enabling users to collaborate and learn together.
## Educator Access
Section Navigation: Educators can effortlessly navigate between different sections, ensuring flexibility in lesson delivery.
Lesson Customization: Educators can repeat the current section, go back to the previous section or advance to the next, offering adaptability to individual student needs.
Lesson Creation: Educators have the power to create, edit, or remove lessons through the web portal, tailoring the content to specific educational objectives.
Hologram Customization: Educators can adjust the sizes of holograms and customize questions, narration, and visual and audio cues for the users.
## Conclusion
HoloType represents a significant step towards making quality education accessible to individuals with unique learning needs. our user study demonstrates the potential of this application to be a valuable resource for a population that faces limited access to educational opportunities as a result of their motor and sensory challenges.
